You can connect your WebStorm to your GitHub by going into WebStorm and doing the following: <br>
For **Windows** and **Linux**, go to File -> Settings -> Version Control -> GitHub and click "Add Account" <br>
For **MacOS**, go to WebStorm -> Settings -> Version Control -> GitHub and click "Add Account" <br>

**Glossary** <br />

**Branch** - A branch is a parallel version of a repository that allows you to make changes without changing the active version of the repository.<br />
**Clone** - A clone is a duplicate of a repository stored on your comptuer instead of on a server. The remote clone is still linked to the original repository. This means that you can make changes through your editor of choice, and then push those changes back to the repository or vice versa.<br />
**Commit** - A commit is a saved change to part of a repository. Commits should have a commit message describing the changes made for documentation. <br />
**Fetch** - Fetching allows you to add changes from your remote repository to the local branch without committing them. This allows you to review the changes before they are committed to the branch.<br />
**GIT** - GIT is an open source program used to track changes in text based files. It was created by the author of the Linux operating system.<br />
**Github** - GitHub is a hosting service for Git code. <br />
**Merge** - Merging takes changes from one branch and applies them to another.<br />
**Merge Conflict** - A merge conflict is an issue that occurs when people make conflicting changes to a file, or when an edited file is deleted. Merge conflicts have to be resolved before the merge can occur.<br />
**Push** - To push is to send committed changes to a remote repository. <br />
**Pull** - To pull is to fetch changes and merge them with your copy of a file.<br />
**Remote** - Remote repositories/branches are the versions of repositories/branches hosted on a server like GitHub<br />
**Repository** - A repository is the base of any project. It stores all of the project files, documentation, and revision history.<br />
